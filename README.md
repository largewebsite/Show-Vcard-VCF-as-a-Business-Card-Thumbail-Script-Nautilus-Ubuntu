# Show-Vcard-VCF-as-a-Business-Card-Thumbail-Script-Nautilus-Ubuntu
Change the Vcard .VCF file thumbnail to show as a Business Card Thumbail 
with photo of the contact and phone email name contact information / 
a Script that can be used in Nautilus Ubuntu to change the thumbnails for 
all vcards / vcf files in a folder and all of its subfolders. 

Currently the VCF / Vcard Files do not have a thumbnail that shows 
the information in the vcard as an easy to differentiate image listing 
all of the information including the photo, name, company name, title, email, phone, 
website etc.

We are developing a tool that can allow you to change all of the Vcard thumbnails to 
a newly created business card with photo looking like thumbnail on each vcard contact
file so that it is easy to see all of the information as a file grid in Nautilus or 
another file browser
